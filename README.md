# Advent of Code 2019

I'm solving [this year's puzzles](https://adventofcode.com) with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) again, and my goals are pretty simple:

- **Forget the leaderboard.** Each puzzle is released at midnight Eastern, so 11pm my time. AoC is for fun, but not the kind of fun that moves me to sacrifice sleep.
- **Complete day 8.** I've either gotten stuck by the puzzle or overwhelmed with life/work by day 7. The latter doesn't seem like a factor this year (fingers crossed), and I hope forgetting the leaderboard helps with the former. :)
- **Experiment.** Last year, I started using new data structures I don't use on a daily basis, and I found out how helpful sets and maps can be. On top of that, I am the world's worst when it comes to testing code, so I'm using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to get better about it.
